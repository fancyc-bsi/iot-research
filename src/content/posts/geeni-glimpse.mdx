excerpt: 'A detailed security analysis of the Geeni Glimpse IoT camera'
---


# Introduction 

This walkthrough will contain a breakdown of my methodoligy and approach for hardware hacking.
I'll discuss my process for the following main areas: 
- Visual inspection and component identification
- UART transmission analysis
- firmware extraction/modification
- Obtaining a root shell
- Reviewing network communications from/to the device 
- Inspecting open ports
- Review cloud server traffic 
- Attempt to reverse engineer critical binaries
- Bypass SSL pinning or integrity checks on the mobile app to view cleartext traffic

The original purpose for this research was to actually fix my camera that would simply not pair. I tried all of the troubleshooting steps and eventually chose to just take the device apart.

Upon doing so, I noticed some very clearly labled "RX" and "TX" pads, indicating UART which will allow us to obtain a serial console on the device.

Our inital shell is blocked by a login prompt, but we are able to bypass this with some firmware modifications. 

I managed to successfully obtain a root shell on the device, bypass the android application SSL pinning and finally, properly pair the device.

# Firmware Extraction and Modification

I performed a "Chip off" firmware extraction for this device, meaning I physically removed the flash chip with hot air.

Analysis was then conducted on the firmware using binwalk and a personally devloped tool for directory crawling of IOT firmware.
    
- https://github.com/fancyc-bsi/tox/blob/main/tox.py

## Method 1: DTB Modification

> Note: This approach was attempted but did not yield successful results.

![[Pasted image 20241204110345.png]]

During the uboot process, we interupt the device from completing the initalization. This will let us print evrioment variables and other useful info.

### Modified Approach

1. **Extract the Device Tree Blob (DTB)**
   ```bash
   dd if=firmware-original.bin of=original_dtb.bin bs=1 skip=212992 count=45056
   ```

2. **Convert DTB to readable format**
   ```bash
   dtc -I dtb -O dts -o original.dts original_dtb.bin
   ```

3. **Make modifications**
   - Edit `original.dts`
   - Change `init=/sbin/init` to `init=/bin/sh`

4. **Convert back to DTB**
   ```bash
   dtc -I dts -O dtb -o modified_dtb.bin original.dts
   ```
> **Important Note**: The DTB modification must stay within the 45056 byte limit to maintain firmware integrity.

5. **Create modified firmware**
   ```bash
   cp firmware-original.bin modded_firmware.bin
   dd if=modified_dtb.bin of=modded_firmware.bin bs=1 seek=212992 conv=notrunc
   ```

### Confirmation
We extract the firmware again and grep for the changes we just made.

![[Pasted image 20241204134108.png]]

6. **Flash the modified firmware**
   ```bash
   minipro -p 'XM25QH64C@SOIC8' -w modded_firmware.bin
   ```

### Why didn't this work?
Due to the inittab being responsible for the inital entrypoint, our modifications were never being touched.

In the next session I'll discuss the method that actually worked and how.


## Method 2: Modifying inittab

### Initial Analysis
Let's examine the filesystem. Here's what we find in `/etc/inittab`:

```sh
# /etc/inittab
# Copyright (C) 2010 Anyka
# Note: BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels. The runlevels field is
# completely ignored by BusyBox init. If you want runlevels, use
# sysvinit.
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# id == tty to run on, or empty for /dev/console
# runlevels == ignored
# action == one of sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, and once
# process == program to run

# Startup the system
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
ttySAK0::respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttySAK0 115200 vt100 # GENERIC_SERIAL
::restart:/sbin/init
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a
```

### Making Modifications
We'll modify the inittab file to drop us into a root shell instead of getty. Here's the modified version:

```sh
# Modified /etc/inittab
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
#ttySAK0::respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttySAK0 115200 vt100 # GENERIC_SERIAL
ttySAK0::respawn:/bin/sh
::restart:/sbin/init
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Extract the SquashFS filesystem**
   ```sh
   # Extract at offset 1847296 (0x1C3000)
   dd if=firmware-original.bin of=rootfs.squashfs bs=1 skip=1847296 count=1929608
   ```

2. **Unpack the filesystem**
   ```sh
   unsquashfs rootfs.squashfs && cd squashfs-root
   ```

3. **Modify the configuration**
   ```sh
   nano etc/inittab
   ```

4. **Create new SquashFS**
   ```sh
   cd .. && mksquashfs squashfs-root new_rootfs.squashfs -comp xz -b 131072 -noappend
   ```

5. **Create modified firmware**
   ```sh
   cp firmware-original.bin modded_firmware.bin && \
   dd if=new_rootfs.squashfs of=modded_firmware.bin bs=1 seek=1847296 conv=notrunc
   ```

6. **Flash the modified firmware**
   ```sh
   minipro -p 'XM25QH64C@SOIC8' -w modded_firmware.bin
   ```

---

# Obtaining Root
After flashing our new firmware back onto the device, we solder the chip back on. 

Then, we attach our pogo pins to the "TX" and "RX" pads on the device, start picocom and hope our modification was successful.

```sh
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0 
```
> -b is for baud rate, 115200 is the most common one so was tried first.

![[Pasted image 20241204210444.png]]

## Filter Script 

After obtaining a root shell on the device, the terminal was extremely crowded with log messages.
I created a script to filter out the noise and allow me to focus on the directory structure more clearly.

- https://github.com/fancyc-bsi/iot-research/blob/main/tools/uart_filter.py

# Fixing the camera

I setup a isolated test network with rules that will auto-route HTTP and HTTPS traffic through my testing machine.

- https://github.com/fancyc-bsi/iot-research/blob/main/tools/mitm.sh

The goal is to connect the IOT device to my test network.

```bash
ps aux --> search for : anyka_service.sh and anyka_ipc
```

kill the bash script first, otherwise it will just perform like watchdog and reboot the service 
```bash
kill -9 419  # anyka_service.sh
kill -9 549  # anyka_ipc
```

```bash
iwconfig wlan0 # make sure the the device is in managed mode  

ip link set wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
ip link set wlan0 up
```

after browsing the firmware and reading the bash scripts, it seems like there is already a utility for wifi connections, if this doesnt work we will try the actual wpa_cli.

```sh
/usr/sbin/wifi_connect.sh "starship" "mypassword"
```

now it is connected to the wifi :) 

![[Pasted image 20241207170809.png]]

now we can nmap the host and connect via telnet:

![[Pasted image 20241207170945.png]]

we could not crack the root password - so we simply change the root password on the device to '123' via the 'passwd' command:

# UDP 

Sometimes the following will be triggered:

```sh
sort_rev_data: 0x00d2 0x0080 0x010a 0x016d 0x0179 0x0170
sort_rev_data: 0x00c1 0x0081 0x0161 0x0173 0x0173 0x0177
sort_rev_data: 0x00d7 0x0082 0x016f 0x0172 0x0164 0x010e
sort_rev_data: 0x00a5 0x0083 0x0141 0x015a 0x016d 0x016c
sort_rev_data: 0x008b 0x0084 0x0170 0x0156 0x015a 0x017a
sort_rev_data: 0x00f8 0x0085 0x016b 0x014e 0x015f 0x0164
sort_rev_data: 0x00fb 0x0086 0x0148 0x0179 0x0173 0x0174
sort_rev_data: 0x00aa 0x0087 0x0161 0x0172 0x0173 0x0168
```

the current assumption is that the device running the mobile app will broadcast the ssid, token and password of the wifi network, and sees if the camera responds to the pairing request


![[Pasted image 20241211091603.png]]

I got blocked, which is impressive - I restarted my router to get a new public IP, which fixed the issue:

![[Pasted image 20241211093505.png]]

After analysis of the wireshark traffic, the conclusion I came to is that the app running on the phone will initate a series of UDP broadcasts and a unique token every time.

The camera is listening for this broadcast via the anyka_ipc binary, as the above packets decode into my test network SSID and password, along with a token.
As shown here:

```sh
Decoding data...

Attempt 1 - Basic shift decode:

myp
assw
ord
AZml
pVZz
kN_d
Hyst
arsh

Attempt 2 - Combined string:

mypasswordAZmlpVZzkN_dHystarship

Final string:
password == mypassword
token == AZmlpVZzkN_dHy
SSID == starship
```

# Drozer

https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/drozer-agent/releases/tag/3.1.0
```sh
adb install drozer-agent.apk
```

Make sure drozer is running on the android device
```sh
drozer console connect
```

```sh
adb forward tcp:31415 tcp:31415
```

```sh
drozer console connect
```


![[Pasted image 20241211143052.png]]


```sh
run app.package.attacksurface com.merkuryinnovations.geeni

Attempting to run shell module
Attack Surface:
  6 activities exported
  3 broadcast receivers exported
  0 content providers exported
  3 services exported
```

![[Pasted image 20241211143653.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241211143751.png]]


![[Pasted image 20241211143918.png]]

This tells us where the data is stored for the app, we can check it for databases or other info that might be written to local storage
```sh
adb shell 
su
```

```sh
cd /data/user/0/com.merkuryinnovations.geeni
```

![[Pasted image 20241211144040.png]]

lets see if any of these are valuable, all the DBs on the camera were password protected, lets see if its the same here

![[Pasted image 20241211144150.png]]

Since our android is a physical device rooted with magisk, we need to copy the database files to a directory a normal user has the permissions to - like the sdcard. 
```sh
cp -r /data/user/0/com.merkuryinnovations.geeni/databases/* /sdcard/

```

we pull the files from the device and browse the data:

![[Pasted image 20241211145857.png]]

nothing here

```rust
[-] mqttAndroidService.db => not encrypted but empty
[-] tuyasmart_encrypt.db => encrypted
[-] tuyasmart_l => not encrypted, contains data but doesn't appear to be useful
[-] ty_tracker.db => not encrypted, contains useless data 
```

![[Pasted image 20241211150532.png]]

extract from tuyasmart_l

# Attacking the Mobile App

![[Pasted image 20241210175413.png]]


-> not working due to root detection (shocking)

we now will attempt to embed the frida gadget into the apk, then use objection to disable root / ssl pinning

```sh
apktool d -o unpack com-merkuryinnovations-geeni_4.0.1_none_merge.apk
```

```sh
cd unpack/lib/arm64-v8a
```

```sh
wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.5.9/frida-gadget-16.5.9-android-arm64.so.xz
```

```sh
7z x frida-gadget-16.5.9-android-arm64.so.xz
```

```sh
mv frida-gadget-16.5.9-android-arm64.so libfrida-gadget.so
```


We need to add this line to ensure the frida lib is loaded 
```xml
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:allowNativeHeapPointerTagging="false" android:appComponentFactory="androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory" android:extractNativeLibs="true" android:hardwareAccelerated="true" android:icon="@mipmap/a961576" android:label="@string/app_name" android:largeHeap="true" android:name="com.smart.app.SmartApplication" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/c961576" android:preserveLegacyExternalStorage="true" android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" android:resizeableActivity="true" android:supportsRtl="false" android:theme="@style/Default_Public_Theme">
```

Confirming our write was successful 
```xml
cat AndroidManifest.xml | grep -i extractNativeLibs
    <application android:allowBackup="false" android:allowNativeHeapPointerTagging="false"  android:appComponentFactory="androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory" android:extractNativeLibs="true" android:hardwareAccelerated="true" android:icon="@mipmap/a961576" android:label="@string/app_name" android:largeHeap="true" android:name="com.smart.app.SmartApplication" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/c961576" android:preserveLegacyExternalStorage="true" android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" android:resizeableActivity="true" android:supportsRtl="false" android:theme="@style/Default_Public_Theme">
```


Now we have to identify the main Activity 
"FamilyHomeActivity" appears to stick out
```xml
<activity android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|navigation|orientation|screenLayout|screenSize|smallestScreenSize" android:excludeFromRecents="true" android:exported="false" android:launchMode="singleTask" android:name="com.thingclips.smart.hometab.activity.FamilyHomeActivity" android:screenOrientation="behind" android:theme="@style/Splash.Theme" android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"/>

<activity-alias android:exported="true" android:name="com.thingclips.smart.hometab.activity.FamilyHomeActivity.alias" android:targetActivity="com.thingclips.smart.hometab.activity.FamilyHomeActivity">
```

we need to find where this class is being defined, sorting through the files this sticks out:

```sh
smali_classes10/com/thingclips/smart/hometab/activity/FamilyHomeActivity.smali
```

we target the following section 

```java
.method public constructor <init>()V
    .locals 1

    .line 1
    invoke-direct {p0}, Lcom/thingclips/smart/hometab/activity/Hilt_FamilyHomeActivity;-><init>()V

    .line 2
    .line 3
    .line 4
    const/4 v0, 0x0
    
    .line 5
    iput-boolean v0, p0, Lcom/thingclips/smart/hometab/activity/FamilyHomeActivity;->e:Z

    .line 6
    .line 7
    return-void
```

and convert it to this

```java
.method public constructor <init>()V
    .locals 1

    const-string v0, "frida-gadget"
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V

    invoke-direct {p0}, Lcom/thingclips/smart/hometab/activity/Hilt_FamilyHomeActivity;-><init>()V

    const/4 v0, 0x0
    iput-boolean v0, p0, Lcom/thingclips/smart/hometab/activity/FamilyHomeActivity;->e:Z

    return-void
```

Now we have to re-pack the modded apk 

```sh
apktool b --use-aapt2 -o mod-app.apk unpack/
```

Next we ZIPalign the apk file:

```sh
zipalign 4 mod-app.apk final-mod-app.apk
```

All APK files need to be signed by a key. We run the following command to create a java key store (JKS):

```sh
keytool -genkey -v -keystore custom.keystore -alias mykeyaliasname -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Enter a password with at least 6 chars and press enter through the prompts until the prompt for yes/no - Now sign the APK  with our newly created JKS:

```sh
apksigner sign -ks custom.keystore final-mod-app.apk
```

We enter the password we setup for the keystore, the app should be ready to push to the device now.

```sh
adb install final-mod-app.apk
```

!TODO == crop

## Attacking the app - finding the correct version

From the observations above, the app has an anti tamper measure, it will not load if this check fails, I attempted to merge the two files into one and inject the gadget into the merged apk, this failed.

Now we will try a different approach, attempting to use an older version of the app to see if this integrity check is enabled on all builds.

`https://apk.support/download-app/com.merkuryinnovations.geeni/54/2.0.1`
version 2.0.1(54) does not appear to have the check. 

we try to simply use apk-mitm : 

```sh
./apk-mitm-linux geeni.apk
[+] Executable file path: /tmp/apk-mitm-tempdir1012532987/apk-mitm-executable
[+] Arguments: [geeni.apk]

  ╭ apk-mitm v1.3.0
  ├ apktool v2.9.3
  ╰ uber-apk-signer v1.3.0

  ✔ Decoding APK file
  ✔ Applying patches

   Done!  Patched file: ./geeni-patched.apk

[+] Patching complete!
```

and install on the device 

```sh
adb install geeni-patched.apk
Performing Streamed Install
Success
```

and now the app launches with no issues:

![[Pasted image 20241210220724.png]]

we go through the motions of setting up the device on this old build, it seems to send the same Bluetooth packets to initialize the pairing process we discovered from the picocom logs earlier 

!!TODO == add ble packets here

![[Pasted image 20241210224852.png]]

## Proxying the traffic through burp

now that we have a build with pinning bypassed we can view the setup process from the apps perspective 

![[Pasted image 20241210225029.png]]

it seems as though everything is happening from the server to the client and the app is just a heartbeat 

## BLE analysis

We enabled HCI snoop logging on our rooted android device 

![[Pasted image 20241210225157.png]]

this will allow us to view the provisioning process via bluetooth 

```sh
adb bugreport
```

this will produce a zip containing all the logs from the device, we only need the bluetooth
```sh
cd FS/data/misc/bluetooth
```

```sh
wireshark -r logs/btsnooz_hci.log
```


```sh
sort_rev_data: 0x00d7 0x0082 0x016f 0x0172 0x0164 0x010e
sort_rev_data: 0x0097 0x0083 0x0141 0x015a 0x0141 0x0170
sort_rev_data: 0x00e4 0x0084 0x0170 0x0141 0x015a 0x0162
sort_rev_data: 0x00a1 0x0085 0x0163 0x0168 0x015f 0x0164
sort_rev_data: 0x00fb 0x0086 0x0148 0x0179 0x0173 0x0174
sort_rev_data: 0x00aa 0x0087 0x0161 0x0172 0x0173 0x0168
sort_rev_data: 0x00d2 0x0088 0x0169 0x0170 0x0100 0x0100
```


nothing seems to match this packet data, so if its not being sent from the app, or over bluetooth - then it must be sent over UDP.

# Monitoring the Filesystem

We create a simple binary that will run on the device, it will monitor any file changes during the anyka_ipc runtime.

![[Pasted image 20241219131515.png]](All files written during anyka_ipc runtime)

From the results we notice that the certificate is not being written to the filesystem at any point 

The next step is to see if we can put anyka_ipc into debug mode - as it appears sensitive info might be displayed if this is added.

we search for 'simplekv' in ghidra to better understand how to key is being obtained.

we edit the log level fields in /etc/config/anyka_cfg.ini
```sh
sed -i 's/anyka_log_level.*=.*2/anyka_log_level                = 5/' anyka_cfg.ini
sed -i 's/iot_log_level.*=.*0/iot_log_level                = 5/' anyka_cfg.ini
sed -i 's/lv_log_level.*=.*0/lv_log_level                = 5/' anyka_cfg.ini
```

Now we are seeing new log messages with debugging enabled

Sadly, after inspecting the anyka_ipc binary some more, we find it is not dynamically linked, so LD-Preloading will not work. 

Additionally, the following methods will not work:

```rust
[-] Building a custom version of gdb => the camera does not support debugging in the kernel
[-] Strace => same reason as above
[-] File monitor => the binary has certificates and encryption keys embedded in the binary, it never writes them to a temp file during execution
```

What would potentially work is decompiling the binary with ghidra, making some edits and repacking it - that will be out of scope for now.

# Conclusion
Overallm I was surprised to see all the security messures on this device and mobile application. 

There were a lot measures in place preventing me from attacking the cloud application or decrypting any of the databases

as a quick summary, I was able to accomplish the following:

```rust
[+] Obtain root access over the device 
[+] "Fix" the device to be able to pair properly 
[+] Decompile and review the sourcecode of the main entrypoint "anyka_ipc"
[+] SSL pinning attack on the mobile app 
[+] Create an auto-exploit script to gain a telnet shell on the device via UART
[+] Connect the device to my test network and review all the network traffic
```

Thanks for reading!
